# students-analytics-dashboard
Collects Students Experience in a digital way. Pet project to learn new technologies and apply my knowledge.


In this project  students can take a survey and respond to questions.
Questions can be all different types. 
And options will be stored separately from questions. 
We will store all responses in one table. If needed we will pull option type into response table. 

For the reason to learn the same thing my colleagues lear, so I can use this at my work I decided to use Vue to make frontend. Maybe this is not what Cursor initially advised, I am the boss here.
